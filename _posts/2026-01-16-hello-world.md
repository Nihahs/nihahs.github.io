Welcome to my corner of the internet. Over Christmas break, I built an iOS app almost entirely with AI. This is the story of how that happened.

## The Problem

I travel long distances with two cats. Cats don't adapt easily to long journeys, unfamiliar environments, or sudden changes in routine—so planning a route that works for them takes more thought than just picking the fastest drive.

I used to drive from Chennai to Goa, breaking the journey with an overnight halt in Bengaluru. After moving to Hyderabad, those natural stop points disappeared. Planning cat-friendly routes became significantly harder.

I looked for an app that could help. Couldn't find one. So I built it.

## The Twist

I had zero iOS experience. I'd never written a line of Swift in my life.

Over the Christmas break, I built [PurrPilot](https://purrpilot.com)—a route planning app for cat parents—almost entirely with AI assistance using Claude. And it actually shipped.

That experience changed how I think about building software. I didn't write most of the code myself. But I shipped something real, built from actual travel constraints and lived experience.

This blog is where I'll share what that journey looks like.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Shipping iOS apps with AI** - What it's actually like to build apps when you're not writing most of the code
- **Scope decisions** - How to decide what to build (and what not to build)
- **The human side of AI-assisted development** - Prompting, reviewing, debugging code you didn't write
- **Honest reflections** - Because I think there's value in transparency about this new way of building

Here's to shipping software in whatever way works for you.
